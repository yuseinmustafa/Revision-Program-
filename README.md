# Revision-Program-

This is a revision program created for GCSE Computer Science students. This program will help students who decide to revise the content from the two year course, which has two papers at the end. The student must enter a username; *there are only **three** usernames available, and they are:*
- user 1 
- user 2 
- user 3

## IMPORTANT:
**The usernames must be entered with a lower key!**



**There is ONLY one password available: password123. 
This also must be entered with low keyes!**

The program will first ask the studet/user to enter their username, whcih is one of the above. 
Afterwards, if entered username is valid, a message will be outputted and they student will be asked to enter their **password**. 
However, if the entered username is **NOT VALID**, the user will be asked if they'd like to enter their username again, if they say "yes", they will be asked to enter their username again, however, if they say "no", a "Bye" message will be outputted and the program will end. 

Then the user will enter their password, if it is valid they will have gained access to their account and should choose what they wish to revise. 
If the password is invalid, the identical process as the username will follow for the password too. 




When everything is sorted out with the username and password, and once they are valid, a message will be outputted and the user will be asked to select a *"jobID"*.
The *"jobID"* should be selected from 1 to 8. Once this is selected by the user, depending on what the user chose, their task for revision will be outputted with their task and jobID.

The program then will generate a randomly selected task and jobID between 9 and 20 and again there will be a message outputted with the randomly selected task.
